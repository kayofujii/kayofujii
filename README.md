## Hi there 👋
🧑‍💻 I'm a web developer and designer with five years of experience.
🌱 I released two apps using Python and Ruby.  
📕 My online book on creating apps with Python and JavaScript has sold to over 50 users on the Japanese platforms [Zenn](https://zenn.dev/fujiikayo/books/fc501522bcff6e) and [note](https://note.com/kcatyo/m/mc4a622868c73).
